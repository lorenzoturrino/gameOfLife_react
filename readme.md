A small repo to teach myself React  building an implementation of the [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

Run instructions:
* Use any server to serve both index.html and script.js on the same path.
* A possible way to do this quick and locally:
  * Install [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) globally `$ npm install -g http-server`
  * Run the server in the main folder `$ http-server`
  * Open a browser on `http://localhost:8080/index.html` (port may change)
  * Have fun
